                        The use of fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas are causing irreversible effects
                        that are destroying our planet. Carbon emissions from the processes of generating energy from
                        fossil fuels are polluting our atmosphere and increasing greenhouse gases. This is the cause of
                        global warming and climate change. By using alternative energy sources like green energy, you
                        can help to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and help the planet work its way back to balance.
                        Furthermore, green energy enhances the reliability and security of the nation’s power grid. The
                        increase of green/renewable energy industries is also creating new job opportunities for people.
                        Green energy is also becoming more affordable, since it must compete with nonrenewable energy.
                        Green energy is perfect for communities in rural/remote areas that aren’t connected to a power grid.

                            Wind energy is harnessed from the kinetic energy of moving wind/air by using the mounted blades
                            to convert it into rotational energy to feed to a generator which wil in turn produce electrical
                            energy. In the US in 2023, wind power provided 10% of total electricity in the US and around 50%
                            in specific states, with large amounts of growth in enterprise and consumer usage in 2023.

                            Solar Power is derived from the suns radiant/light energy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) cells, that are
                            commonly used in solar panels, are used to convert this radiant energy to electrical energy as
                            sunlight strikes the semiconductor material of the PV cell, creating an electric current. Solar
                            power has also been on an increase in usage, as in 2023 it accounted for about 5% of total energy
                            production and use in the US.

                            Hydroelectric energy has been around for a long time in the US, being one of the most reliable
                            sources of power in the US for quite a long time. It operates similarly to wind, with flowing
                            water moving through what is typically a dam, turning turbines, which then turn generators,
                            giving us electrical energy from the waters kinetic energy. In 2023 hydroelectric power
                            produced 6% of all power in the US, but it has unfortunately been on the decline since then.

                        There are several different kinds of green energy that can be used in homes. The two most popular
                        are solar energy and wind energy. These kinds of energy can also be used in different ways to
                        generate electricity for various needs. Another form of energy that can be used for specific
                        types of homes is hydropower. Geothermal energy is another ideal form of energy for people who live
                        nearby places of geothermal activity, such as Montana, and Hawai'i which can be very effective, given
                        that they can produce lots of clean, and easily usable. For more information on each source, check out
