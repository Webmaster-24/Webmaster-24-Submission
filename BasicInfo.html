                        Green energy, in simple terms, is energy that can be produced or retrieved from a source using a
                        method that causes no harm to the environment. It is often associated with renewable energy, but
                        there is a difference between the two. Renewable energy is naturally sustainable energy because
                        it can be naturally renewed. Some examples of this are wind and solar power. Renewable energy,
                        however, may result in carbon emissions during the process of generating the energy, which is
                        what makes it different from green energy.

                            The most common green energy source used in homes is solar power. Solar photovoltaic (PV)
                            systems use sunlight and turn it into electricity. Depending on how many solar panels are
                            used, solar energy can power an entire household and all its needs.

                            Wind energy in a home involves installing small-scale wind turbines, usually on rooftops or
                            in yards, to harness kinetic energy from the wind. As the turbine blades rotate, this
                            mechanical energy is converted into electricity by a generator. The generated power can be
                            used immediately, stored in batteries, or fed back into the grid, providing a sustainable
                            and renewable energy source for residential use.

                            Geothermal energy in terms of heating works by drawing heat into or out of your home in order
                            to heat it or cool it down, whichever is needed at a point in time. Geothermal works for
                            producing electricity by using the heated solution it draws up to heat water to make steam and
                            spinning turbines with it.
