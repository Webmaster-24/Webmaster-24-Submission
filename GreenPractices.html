                    Solar panel installation
                </h2>
                <div class = "yapping">

                    First comes filling out the proper permits, determining how many panels you would wish to place, and
                    how many KWh your system would produce.

                    The process of installation is simple as well, requiring only a preliminary inspection to tell where
                    to place the panels, depending on the placement or size of your home, it could be on the roof, windows,
                    or even on your front lawn, the whole process will take 6 hours to 3 days, making it a quick and
                    easy process

                    Now, with the federal government covering 30% of installation costs until 2034, and your local and
                    state governments being able tp give deductions in the form of tax credits as well, renewable has never
                    been more appealing.

                    Wind Turbine Installation
                </h2>
                <p class="yapping">
                    The process of installing wind turbines is slightly less convenient and easy, but is definitely more
                    convenient to people who live in more spread out, or rural areas.

                    First comes the permitting process, by which you have to get all of your permissions to install your
                    turbines this can take more or less time, depending mainly on where you live and what the conditions
                    are like as well as zoning laws.

                    The installation process can take up to 3 weeks due to having to dig a ditch for each turbines'
                    foundation, and having to run all the wiring and set up the turbines themselves.

                    Yet again, you will receive tax credits for using wind for your residence, from all levels of government.

                    Geothermal HVAC/Power installation
                </h2>
                <div class = "yapping">
                    The first step in geothermal power is doing a survey on where you live and checking first whether it
                    is suitable or even worth your time in that area. Some things may be size and the amount of heating/
                    cooling needed for your home, and the geothermal activity and thermal efficiency of your home.

                    After that, you have to install your geothermal loop, putting down pipes in the ground that will carry
                    an antifreeze fluid up and down the pipes to conduct a heat transfer, making the energy transfer between
                    the earth and your home possible.

                    While there may not be as many savings except for the subsidized installation from your government,
                    you will still end up saving a ton on your electricity bills, with your thermostat being powered by
                    the earth.
