                    You can save at least 30% of what you pay to install your installation, and that is only the federal
                    government benefits through 2034, there is still the benefits and subsidies you could be getting from
                    your state, county, and even municipal governments for playing your part in saving the environment.
                    Many green energy types will also have some sort of benefits again depending on where you live, making
                    you money back on your taxes back years later, helping this investment pay itself off!

                    On the right we can see the pricing of various types of renewable energy sources compared to each
                    other and coal. We can see how the different types compare to each other, and how you could get
                    money back from the grid and making money back from the grid by using net metering. We can also see
                    the differences in the pricing of what it takes to install the facilities to harness each of these
                    renewable energy sources right in your home. We also show you whether it is possible to go completely
                    off the grid with a setup like these.
